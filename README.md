# Chat-based App for Machine Learning Paper Analysis (TechInsights_AI_LLM_Project)

## Overview

This project is a chat-based application built using Streamlit and Langchain, aimed at enabling interactive question answering through queries for efficient analysis of machine learning papers from arXiv. The app utilizes Pinecone for data integration, providing users with a seamless experience in accessing and analyzing research papers.

## Features

- **Interactive Question Answering**: Users can input queries to interactively retrieve information from machine learning papers.
- **Precise Responses**: The application features a custom-engineered LLAma 7B Language Model (LLM) with LangChain abstractions, ensuring precise responses with an accuracy improvement of 74.3% compared to the original Llama Model.
- **Advanced Understanding**: The app implements advanced understanding of intricate machine learning research papers using the LangChain framework, optimizing accessibility and utilizing the power of the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique. This results in a 60% improvement in response rate compared to GPT-4.
- **Semantic Search**: Semantic search capabilities are seamlessly integrated with the fine-tuned LLama model using techniques like QLoRA and LoRA. This provides users with an accurate and comprehensive user experience for retrieving relevant research papers.
